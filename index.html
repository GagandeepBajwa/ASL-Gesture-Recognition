        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The only mode of offline communication for hearing-impaired persons is through sign language. Learning the sign language is convoluted and has many conventions. The aim of this project is to develop an American Sign Language translator in order to mitigate the aforementioned difficulties. Another aim of this project is to develop a hand gesture recognition system to establish human computer interaction.</p>

        <h1>Datasets Used</h1>
        <p>The code was first tested with the Triesch Dataset, after which we created our own dataset, to suit our testing conditions (unideal) as well as, expand our letter-base</p>
        
          <h3>Triesch Dataset</h3> <p>Triesch dataset contains letters a,b,c and v against 3 different backgrounds as shown below.</p>

          <h3>User Dataset</h3><p>The created dataset contains images of letters a,b,c,d,g,i,l,v and y, recorded at different angles and at different distances wrt the camera. <br/>This variation is introduced in order to introduce tolerances for orientation and scale.

          <h4>Data Augmentation</h4>
          <p>Left-Right Hands -> We generate a set of rotated images from the existing images to help train our model to make it more robust.<br/>Tilt/Zoom -> Generated set of images with different levels of tilt and zoom to increase the variety of the training dataset.</p>

          <h3>Hand Segmentation</h3> <p>The Otsu algorithm segments the image into background and foreground. The input image is the grayscaled gaussain blurred image. This method classifies the pixels based on their grayscale pixel values and cluster them into 2 regions. We used this method for hand segmentation due to its invariance to dynamic light conditions </p>
          <p><img src = "imageSegmentation.jpg" width=80%></p>

          <h3>Feature Extraction</h3><p>Various features extracted for an image include the hull points, contour area, convexity defect coordinates, HoG features and bounding box. We particularly selected the HoG features due to clear distinction obtained for individual characters.   
          <p>The <i><b>Contour</b></i> in the image contains a set of all connected points which form the outline of the hand region.</br>The <i><b>Hull</b></i> contains the area included by connecting the extremities (bulging points) of the contour in the detected hand region.</br>The <i><b>Convexity Defects</b></i> are convex regions formed by the area between the fingers in the contour of the hand region. These are called defects because the area between the fingers forms a convex curve in an otherwise concave hull.</br>The <i><b>Bounding Box</b></i> is the minimum rectangle large enough to crop the entire hand region. Computing the ratio of contour area with respect to bounding box area makes the detection invariant to scale.</p>
          <img src = "Features.jpg" width=60% >
          <p><i><b>HoG Features</b></i> have been computed on the contours of each letter in the database. HOG features encode the occurrences of gradient orientations in portions of an image, so it is expected from them to describe characteristic edges regarding the shape of the hands. The figure below shows the HoG features for each letter in the dataset.</p>
